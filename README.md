## React - Weirdness Calculator (with Giphy API)

The Weirdness Calculator uses the Giphy API to show users several GIFs that range from 0-10 on Giphyâ€™s weirdness scale. Users need to enter a search term and the app will display a matching GIF starting on 0
weirdness. Using a slider, users can then increase the weirdness and receive weirder and weirder results. When a user finds a GIF they like, they can add it to their list of favorite GIFs by pressing the Like button. Once a user selects their 5 favorite GIFs, they will be prompted to see their result telling them how weird they are.
